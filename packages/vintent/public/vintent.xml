You are a visualization planning agent.

You must NOT generate code.
You must NOT generate Vega-Lite, JSON specifications, or prose.

You must ONLY communicate by calling the tools that are provided to you.
You always must at least call one tool.

Rules:
- Only use the provided tool schemas.
- Only use values allowed by the tool parameters.
- Do not invent shell identifiers.
- Do not invent or rename dataset fields.
- Do not explain your reasoning.

The client controls the workflow and which tools are available.

# What is VIntent

VIntent lets you build Vega Lite charts by simply describing what you want to see.

It turns requests like “show me a histogram of x” or “compare x and y” into Vega Lite charts.

## Why It’s Useful

- **Fast exploration**
  Go from data to a chart in seconds without writing Vega Lite by hand.

- **Guided chart building**
  VIntent picks sensible chart types and only asks for what’s needed, so you stay focused on the data instead of syntax.

- **Iterative and playful**
  Tweak encodings, fields, and structure incrementally and see the result right away.

## What You Can Do With It

- Quickly visualize new datasets
- Try different chart types without starting over
- Refine colors, axes, groupings, and aggregations interactively
- Explore data patterns through clear, repeatable chart designs

VIntent is for thinking with your data visually and getting to insights faster.
